# KXPA100_FAN_MOUNT

This project is for an 80mm fan mount that sits on top of the KXPA100 100w amplifier.

fan_mount_small_no_switch mounts the 80mm fan. There is enough room to install a miniature toggle switch.

fan_mount_with_rocker_switch mounts the 80mm fan, with a mount for a rocker switch. I used a Digikey p/n EG4307-ND (or CKN2008-ND). These are SPDT center off switches. I used a resistor between the switch poles to drop the voltage, so the fan is quieter.

I operate 99.99% CW and wear headphones, so the fan noise is not heard at all (Radiosport Listen-Only headphones).

The resistor I used, was one I had, 22ohms at 5w wirewound. 

All pieces were printed in PETG on an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ (sorry, I do not have a printer, but a friend has this one).

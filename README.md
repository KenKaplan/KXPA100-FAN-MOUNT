# KXPA100_FAN_MOUNT

This project is for an 80mm fan mount that sits on top of the KXPA100 100w amplifier.

fan_mount_small_no_switch mounts the 80mm fan. There is enough room to install a miniature toggle switch.

fan_mount_with_rocker_switch mounts the 80mm fan, with a mount for a rocker switch. I used a Digikey p/n EG4307-ND (or CKN2008-ND). These are SPDT center off rocker switches. I used a resistor between the switch poles to drop the voltage, so the fan is quieter.

I operate 99.99% CW and wear headphones, so the fan noise is not heard at all (Radiosport Listen-Only headphones).

e resistor I used, was one I had, 22ohms at 5w wirewound. If you do not have an 80mm fan, just do a Google search and you will find plenty on EBay and Amazon. The hole spacing on my fan was 72mm, the height was 25mm.

All pieces were printed in PETG on an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ (sorry, I do not have a printer, but a friend has this one).
